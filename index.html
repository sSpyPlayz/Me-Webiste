            According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.<br>
        Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.<br>
        The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.<br>
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>
        Ooh, black and yellow!<br>
        Let's shake it up a little.<br>
